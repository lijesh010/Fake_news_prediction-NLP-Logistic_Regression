Welcome to the "Fake News Detection Using Logistic Regression and NLP" project repository. In the era of information overload, distinguishing between accurate news and misleading information is crucial. This project aims to leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression to build a model that can automatically detect fake news from genuine news articles.
